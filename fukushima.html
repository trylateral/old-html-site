			<h1>The Fukushima nuclear accident - the shocking death toll from radiation</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Most of you have probably heard of the Fukushima nuclear accident. Many of you might cite it as a reason to turn our backs on nuclear energy in pursuit of technologies perceived to be more "environmentally-friendly" (a challenge: just because a energy source doesn't produce much CO2 or air pollution in the moment when electricity is produced, does that mean it has no impact?). However, if put on the spot to describe what happened at Fukushima, and particularly how many people did the ensuring radiation leak kill, you might struggle to come up with an answer. Here we go then!</p>

		<h3>You: The Fukushima accident was awful and should never have happened!</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>I couldn't agree more! But before we get on to that, let your mind slip back to 2011. There was this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">huge earthquake</a> off the coast of Japan. Likely, you’ll remember it as being the “Fukushima” earthquake, because of the damage to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster"> Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plants</a>, and the media-coverage frenzy that followed. In Japan, the event is known as the 2011 Tōhoku (TOH-ho-ku) earthquake. It was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900 [1].</p>
		<p>Sounds strong but, if you’re like me, you’ll prefer an absolute over a relative number. I recommend reading the first few sections of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">Wikipedia entry</a> yourself (yeah, I use Wikipedia, and so should you), but here I reproduce some of the most interesting figures, with the caveat that many of them are from “media” sources rather than scientific journals or official government statistics:</p>
		<ul style="padding-left:30px; color:#444">
			<li>The force of the earthquake moved Honshu, the main island of Japan, 2.4m to the east [2].</li>
			<li>The tsunami waves were 40.5m high [3], that’s the same as a thirteen story building.</li>
			<li>In places the waves travelled 10km inland, or the distance from Canary Wharf to Hyde Park (if you’re familiar with London) [4].</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The effects of the earthquake were not limited to Japan:</p>
		<ul style="padding-left:30px; color:#444">
			<li>It is estimated that the earthquake shifted the Earth on its axis by 10 to 25cm [5]. Yep, you read that right.</li> 
			<li>And if the Tōhoku earthquake seems to you like it happened only yesterday, maybe that’s because the quake might have increased the Earth’s rotational speed by 1.8µs per day [6]!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Whilst I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the above numbers, sadly we do know that the tremors and ensuing tsunami killed at least 15,984 [7] people, with many more missing, presumed dead. Over a million buildings were damaged or destroyed [8]. The World Bank estimated the cost of recovery and reconstruction to be US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in history [9][10]. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: Ok, I get it, it was a bad earthquake...</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">	
		<p>I’m sorry if it feels like I’m labouring the point – and there is one coming, I promise – but it’s important to remember just how powerful the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was before we get to what happened at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: Got it. So what happened - why was there an accident?</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>I’m not going to give the blow-by-blow Fukushima story – you can read the Diet (parliament) of Japan’s produced an official report <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/mori1/docs/NAIIC_report_hi_res10.pdf">here</a>.</p>
		<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report [11] is probably the most authoritative and informative, and anything I discuss below related to the accident is taken from their work. If you don’t have hours to burn, the Encyclopaedia Britannica (yes, they do still exist) summarised the incident succinctly <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Fukushima-accident">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Contrary to what you may assume, there is no evidence of damage to the main safety systems of the Fukushima Daiichi plants (there were three reactors involved) from the earthquake itself (i.e. from ground vibrations). The problem lay in the plant operators’ underestimation of the likelihood of large tsunamis and the damage they might cause.</p>
		<p>Tsunami flooding caused the Fukushima plants to lose electricity supply to vital systems required to cool nuclear fuel that remains hot (due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_heat">radioactive decay products</a>) even after the reactor has been shut down. TEPCO, the operator of the plants, made valiant efforts to cool the reactor cores as well as what are known as the "Spent Fuel Pools" (a kind of giant swimming pool where old fuel is stored until it has cooled down). </p>
		<p>They also made a series of well-documented mistakes, exacerbated by indecision and unclear division of responsibility between it, the nuclear regulator and the government. The result was a nuclear operator’s worst possible day at the office: some of the nuclear fuel got so hot it melted through its protective containment. You’ve probably heard of this event before, if only in Hollywood sci-fi: a core meltdown. Eventually, some fraction of this leaked fuel made it into the air and sea. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="titles">	
		<h3>You: I knew it! Those fools didn't design the plant properly, putting us all at risk!</h3>		
	</div>	
	
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>There were certainly lessons to learn. The Japanese had been lagging behind European and North American safety standards for some time. Since the accident, the Japanese government has completely overhauled the way the industry is regulated. Most of Japan's large reactor fleet was shut down after the accident, and will remain so until various stress tests have been passed and plant upgrades have been implemented.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="titles">	
		<h3>You: That's the least they could do after all that dangerous radiation they leaked out...just how bad was the radiation leak, anyway?</h3>		
	</div>	

<div class="maintext">
		<p>Before we get to that, this is in no way intended as an apology for mistakes made by the Fukushima Daiichi designers, operators or anyone else, nor do I wish to belittle the real human tragedy of mass evacuation of areas around the Fukushima plant following the accident. </p>
		<p>I only mean to highlight the real-world data from the accident. Quoting naked statistics may seem hard and cold for what is clearly an emotive topic, but I would argue that it’s the only way for us to bring together points-of-view which seem irreconcilable on first impressions.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">	
		<h3>You: OK Mr Careful. So a lot of people died unnecessarily because of this accident, right?</h3>		
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Right - but they didn't die in the way you're probably imagining.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="titles">	
		<h3>You: All their hair falling out and giving birth to three-legged babies?</h3>		
	</div>	
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>By official measures, it was the second-worst accident after Chernobyl, rated <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-accident.aspx">7 on the INES scale</a> (the most severe level). Despite that, the United Nations investigations found that no “early-induced health effects were observed among workers or members of the public” [11, pg13]: this means no one got ill from radiation in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear accident. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">	
		<h3>You: OK. So no-one died straight away, but I bet there'll be lots of cancers in the years to come?</h3>		
	</div>	
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Nope. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) reported to the United Nations General Assembly that: “no discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public and their descendants” [11, pg13]:, i.e. we don’t think that there will be any additional cancers amongst those who lived in and around the Fukushima plants due to the accident. The IAEA did conclude that plant workers would have an increased risk in cancer, but that this increase would be so small that we won’t be able to confirm it even exists [11, pg13]. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">	
		<h3>You: I don't believe you!</h3>		
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>It may seem surprising given what you've heard in the news, but the peer-reviewed science behind the UN studies is fairly clear. If you watched the news you might have convinced yourself that fish would be growing third eyes and children would be born with abnormalities for years to come. This only happens in the Simpsons. Even this, the second-worst nuclear accident (and the worst accident in a developed nation), will have no discernible negative health effects on the workers or public. Some workers did die during the accident due to a related hydrogen explosion, but I am following the typical, if irrational, approach of treating deaths from conventional hazards differently to those from nuclear effects.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: Considering the MASSIVE earthquake, the badly-designed sea defences, the dithering leadership, it seems like things could have been a lot worse?</h3>
	</div>	
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>You're starting to get this now. You see, the amount of radiation picked up by workers and the public were not so large when compared to other sources of radiation, both natural and man-made, to which we are exposed every single day. The typical dose over two weeks for people within the Fukushima exclusion zone was 1 millisievert, or 1 mSv. </p>
		<p>Don't worry if you don’t know what that is, just know that the radiation most of us pick up every year from the rocks, soil, buildings and roads around us, from the food we eat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose">bananas</a> are particularly radioactive) and the air we breathe, and from medical scans such as x-rays, is around 4 mSv. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: My god! Should I cut down my banana intake?</h3>
	</div>	
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>There's no need. Humans have evolved to live with radiation in small doses without any problems. A <a href="https://xkcd.com/radiation/">brilliantly-visual tool</a> to get your head around radiation doses is provided by the online nerd comic xkcd, including doses related to the Fukushima accident. It does a great job in putting into context the different doses we're all subjected to.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: OK. So the amount of radiation leaked was small?</h3>
	</div>	
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>One particular monitoring station close to Fukushima recorded higher doses of around 40 mSv. This 40 mSv value is still within the typically allowed dose for a person who works with radiation as part of their job such as a radiologist, nuclear plant worker, or, surprisingly, an airline pilot (and you, every time you fly) i.e. it's a dose that will not lead to an increased risk of cancer. </p>
		<p>So, the radiation that leaked during the Fukushima accident was a risk to the public (and was preventable), but it hasn't (and probably won't) make anyone ill. This accident happened because of the massive Tohoku earthquake, it affected some of the oldest (i.e. least resilient) nuclear plants in the world, whose sea defences were inadequate, yet it didn’t lead to nuclear Armageddon. </p>
		<p>Just stop to think a second: how many industrial disasters can you think of where people have died, sometimes in their hundreds or thousands? The industrial accident thought of as the world's worst, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster">Bhopal</a> disaster, killed thousands and caused over 500,000 injuries. Vast volumes of toxic gases were leaked from this pesticide plant. Yet did we hear calls for a worldwide ban on pesticide manufacture? 
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: If it wasn't dangerous, explain to me why so many people were evacuated, and for so long.</h3>
	</div>	

	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Surprisingly, it is the way in which the Fukushima evacuation was managed that caused the most damage: around 1000 premature deaths are thought to have occurred as a result of the extended evacuation due to factors such as fatigue, trauma, people’s fear that they’d received a fatal dose of radiation and restricted access to medical care at their evacuation shelter. <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-accident.aspx">90% of the deaths were in persons over the age of 66</a>.</p>
		<p>It’s clear that the main tragedy in the whole Fukushima disaster was maintaining the evacuation beyond a few precautionary days. Put another way, the greatest damage came not from any radiation leak but from misunderstanding what the consequences of such a leak are for us human beings. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: I see...is there a reason that politicians didn't listen to the science?</h3>
	</div>	

	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Because they a) also don’t understand, and b) feared public backlash if they didn’t do as expected. The Japanese government had lost the trust of the public early on in the crisis by being less than straight about the state of the damaged reactor cores. Once that trust was lost, the evacuees resisted being “forced” to return home, fearing the government might be lying about it being safe to do so.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: You obviously think nuclear gets a bad rap, then? If there is a risk of nuclear accidents happening, why do we bother with nuclear when we could be using coal, gas, hydro, wind or solar energy?</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Unlike fossil fuels such as gas and coal, nuclear is a source of low-carbon energy in a world where rising CO2 levels threaten our ecosystems. More importantly, it produces very little waste and zero air pollution. And unlike other low-carbon sources such as solar and wind, nuclear energy is high-intensity (low land use) and high-availability (whatever the weather).</p>
	</div>

	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: What do you mean, "high intensity"?</h3>
	</div>
		
	<div class="maintext">	
		<p>In a world with a growing population and ever-shrinking wilderness, do we really want to convert vast tracts of farmland or nature reserves into sprawling solar farms? Do we really want to slash and burn rainforest to grow biofuels? Is it right to destroy natural water courses with dams for hydro energy? Perhaps it is the right thing to do, but I have not yet seen the arguments to support this idea, nor has there been the proper public discussion. With current (and this could change – look at <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/utilities">what Tesla is doing</a>) energy storage technology, an electricity grid supported entirely by wind and solar is also not feasible because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: I've heard that nuclear is really expensive - isn't that reason enough to get rid of it?</h3>
	</div>
			
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>The cost of nuclear new build compared to renewable new build is too complex to cover in this article, but existing nuclear plants are a cheap source of low-carbon electricity. No matter what you think about new nuclear plants, if you’re really serious about meeting the threats of climate change, air pollution and habitat destruction, you should at least support the continual operation of existing nuclear plants so long as it is safe to do so. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately, in many parts of the world this is not happening. Germany has been on the path towards phasing out nuclear for a while now, but decided to accelerate the closing down of existing nuclear plants following the Fukushima accidents. The current French government seems set to do the same. Germany’s decision to switch off nuclear has led to its continuing dependence on coal whilst other European countries such as the UK have all but phased it out. This has been <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn_383-carbon-footprint-electricity-generation.pdf">terrible for CO2 emissions</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#6e5a57bf709b">air pollution deaths</a> from respiratory illnesses (including cancer), <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/clash-in-german-forest-as-red-line-is-crossed/a-36606405">habitat destruction</a>, and, ironically, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/">radiation emissions</a> (from coal ash)! </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="titles">
		<h3>You: I thought that Germany was a "green" country, so that's surprising. So we should give nuclear a chance, after all?</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>If you take anything away from today, let it be this: nuclear, like all other energy sources, has its pros and cons. These pros and cons should be weighed fairly and objectively, and without treating nuclear as something evil because of the industry’s failure to break the historical link to nuclear weapons. On the contrary, civil nuclear energy has provided the cheap energy our economies needed to become the prosperous societies we live in today, with a minimal contribution to climate change and illness in humans.</p>
