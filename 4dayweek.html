		<h1>How much work is too much work?</h1>
		<blockquote>Originally <a href="trylateral.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/think-different-trylateral/">published</a> in June 2016 on my old wordpress blog.</blockquote>
		<p>I sink obediently once more into my ergonomic chair. I unlock
		the email machine with a reflexual flick of the fingers. Spin, spin,
		spin goes the mouse wheel, the RSI twinge in my right hand a sharp 
		reminder of the hours spent scrolling through reports and spreadsheets.</p>
		<p>Let’s get this right from the start:</p>
		<p>Unlike many people in the world, I have a regular, 
		‘9 to 5′ job that requires very little physical exertion and 
		keeps me warm and dry most of the year. Whilst it doesn’t shower
		me with cash, I have enough to rent a roof over my head, pay my bills 
		and still have something left over for holidays, a flashy phone, trips 
		to the pub, and all the other trappings of modern, middle class life. I
		enjoy my job, most of the time at least. I am an engineer—physicist, 
		really—whose work is helping to provide for the future in a sustainable way.</p>
		<p>I am lucky.</p>
		<p>And yet...</p>
		<p>I have recently taken the decision to change from a five-day to a
		four-day working week. That hopefully sounds to you quite simple and 
		uncontroversial, but I have found there is something subversive in what
		I am doing. Not wanting to work as much as everyone else in the office 
		makes me a little bit odd or, at best, lazy. I was surprised to find much
		of my reasoning carefully set out, and in more effective prose than I might
		achieve, in a short essay by John Maynard Keynes from almost one hundred
		years ago. Let me explain:</p>
		<p>From the depths of pre-history until very recent times, the human
		story was mostly one of survival. Our forebears worked from absolute—in 
		the literal sense of the word—necessity. The need to eat, to house oneself,
		to clothe oneself, and to keep oneself safe from the other; wild animals, 
		wild weather, and more often than not, wild humans.</p>
		<p>As arch-economist Keynes
		predicted in his 1930 essay on the future of our prosperity[1], most of us, 
		in the developed world at least (I’ll try to address how these ideas might
		apply to the developing world in a future post), are now able to meet all 
		our “absolute needs”. Much of the remaining poverty in the developed world 
		might be deemed relative, arising from a sense of inequality rather than a 
		lack of essential goods, or even of basic luxuries. Inequality is an issue
		of itself that I don’t attempt to cover here. Social movements of the 19th
		and 20th century have already assured most of us a five-day working week. 
		These two days are enough time to catch up on forfeited sleep and outstanding
		housework, but not much else. How about, then, working four days a week? 
		Three days? Two?</p>
		<img src="Images/work.jpg" alt="Typical workers."></a>
		<figcaption>Typical workers. Will they too be able to reduce their working hours?</figcaption>
		<p>Keynes predicted that people of the 21st century would suffer from
		“technological unemployment”, i.e. machines taking the jobs of humans 
		faster than new jobs can be created, whilst still meeting all of those
		absolute needs I mentioned previously. He saw this underemployment
		(“three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week”) as a positive thing, 
		envisioning a world freed from toil but enriched by arts, leisure,
		sport, study and other private pursuits.</p>
		<p>What went wrong? Where is Keynes’ utopia?
		Whilst Keynes was right in his prediction that economic output
		would grow many times over as labour-saving technology spread
		to all industries, we have also been remarkably effective at creating 
		new stuff to sell, i.e. creating new demand. As the supply of basic 
		goods grew, demand for luxuries, some of which Keynes could not even
		have conceived, has also grown. More luxuries, more factories, more 
		jobs, more busy workers.</p>
		<p>In addition, the increasingly centralised, 
		state-run world that Keynes experienced has been washed away by the
		tide of neoliberalism that has swept across the world since the fall
		of Communism. The shareholder must at all times have his return on
		investment. Profits must go up every year. The Chancellor of the 
		Exchequer must meet his GDP growth forecast. Continued worldwide 
		GDP growth ensures close to 100% employment. There are many arguments
		for and against such growth (reducing poverty in the developing
		world and environmental impacts being just two issues affected). 
		However, before this post becomes an economics essay, let me ask 
		that question again: Where is Keynes’ utopia?</p>
		<p>I want to find out whether, for a lucky few of us, 
		it is already here, waiting patiently, expectantly, just outside
		the window. Maybe if I break the never-ending cycle of daily 
		commutes and weekend recoveries, if I try a third mode of living 
		for one day a week, I might find my own, small piece of utopia. 
		I might learn new things, travel to places I’ve never been, meet
		new people I’d never otherwise have met, and experience what Keynes 
		referred to as the “art of life”:</p>
		<blockquote>“The strenuous purposeful money-makers may
		carry all of us along with them into the lap of economic
		abundance. But it will be those peoples, who can keep alive,
		 and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself
		 and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be 
		 able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.”</blockquote>
		<p>Of course there are some sacrifices I will have to make
		by taking a 20% pay cut overnight, but that is kind of the point!
		Any sacrifice would only be the loss of a luxury, because I am lucky
		to be middle class and from a developed nation. Hopefully, when
		weighed against twenty-four extra hours of free time every week,
		those won’t be hard choices to make. </p>
		<p>So what has all this got to do with this blog? This blog is, 
		in a way, a record of what I do with my free time that one extra
		free day a week. It is an experiment with no objective and no 
		desired outcome other than to have some fun along the way.  
		To be frank, you have as much idea as I do as to where this path
		will lead. That, of course, is part of its charm.</p>
