		<h1>Are millennials right to complain about houses being less affordable than ever before?</h1>
		<p>Houses are expensive things, especially if you don’t have one. 
		First off I should ‘fess up: I’m one of those
		<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/millennials-should-stop-moaning-theyve-got-more-degrees-and-low-rates">moaning millennials</a>,
		part of the generation that some argue have been most 
		hard-hit by the house price rises of the past 60 or so years, 
		but others argue are a bunch of winging so-and-sos who don’t 
		know how good they have it. I’ll let you decide which is closer 
		to the truth.</p>
		<p>As part of research for another article I’m writing, I started
		wondering just exactly <i>how</i> expensive houses really are, particularly
		when compared to recent history. All the data I use is for England only. I
		live in SE England, the most expensive part of the UK in terms of house prices.</p>
		<p>I started by finding historical data on average house prices in England.
		The UK Office for National Statistics has been officially recording house
		prices only since 2016. It’s latest <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/february2018">statistical bulletin</a>
		backdates prices only as far as 2005 (see Fig 1.).
		<img src="Images/Figure 2_ Average UK house price, January 2005 to February 2018.png" alt="Average UK house prices">
		<figcaption>Fig. 1.  UK house prices since 2005 (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/february2018">Source</a>
		: UK ONS, UK House Price Index: February 2018, Figure 2: Average UK house price, 
		January 2005 to February 2018)</figcaption>
		<p>So prices have increased by £75,000 since just 2005; that’s an increase 
		of 50%. Remember, these are the average house prices, so if you live in 
		certain areas of London or the South East, the increase is likely even higher.
		You can check per local authority area in Figure 5 of this <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingaffordabilityinenglandandwales/1997to2016">report</a>. 
		<p>That’s interesting, but how about further back in time? How much 
		did a house cost in 1990? Or 1960? Nationwide Bank (a UK mortgage provider)
		publishes just such historical data, although methodology changes mean it 
		should be taken with a pinch of salt (see Note 1 below). Fig. 2 shows UK
		average house prices from 1955 to 2018.
		<img src="Images/UK_house_prices.png" alt="Average UK house prices">
		<figcaption>Fig. 2. UK average house prices since 1955 (Source: Nationwide)</figcaption>
		<p>Alright, that makes it look like houses in 1955 were basically free, 
		so I went ahead and indexed all the prices to the average price in 1955 (see Fig. 3).</p>
		<img src="Images/UK_house_prices_indexed.png" alt="Average UK house prices">
		<figcaption>Fig. 3. UK average house prices indexed against 1955 prices (1955 price = 100) (Source: Nationwide)</figcaption>
		<p>Of course, the quality of houses available in 2018 may be different to that in 1955, 
		but not by much. Based on Fig. 3, I’m going to be lazy and say that the same house 
		bought in 2018 would cost you, on average, 101 times the price you would have paid 
		had you bought it in 1955.</p>
		<p>What about wage inflation? Of course houses cost more in 2018 that in 1955
		because we’re not all earning 9s 5d a week (please no comments about 
		whether this is an accurate wage in old money – I have absolutely no idea).
		This is where we can start to put into context the changing cost of housing
		by looking at how what we've earned has changed over time. </p>
		<p>The ONS reports house prices against earnings back as far as 1998 
		(see Fig. 4). You can see that house price rises are outstripping wage 
		rises by quite some margin. That means that even though your salary may
		be increasing, it likely isn’t increasing quick enough to keep up with
		the cost of buying a house. On the other hand, if you already own a house
		then you’re basically rolling in it.</p>
		<img src="Images/Figure 2_ Median price paid for property and annual earnings indices.png" alt="Average UK house prices against earnings">
		<figcaption>Fig. 4 House prices vs earnings (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingaffordabilityinenglandandwales/1997to2016">Source</a>:
		UK ONS, Housing affordability in England and Wales: 2016, Figure 2: 
		Median price paid for property and annual earnings indices)</figcaption>
		<p>I wanted to look further back. 1998 already feels like 
		the “modern” era of housing, where credit was easy and interest rates 
		low – two factors likely to push up prices.  The Nationwide house price
		data went back as far as 1952, but the UK ONS does not provide median
		annual earnings further back than 1998. However, they do have data on 
		what’s called “real households' disposable income per head, CVM NSA” 
		(See Note 2). Fig. 5 shows this real income per head against time.</p>
		<img src="Images/UK_income_perhead.png" alt="Income per head against time">
		<figcaption>Fig.5 Real household's disposable income (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihxy/ukea">Source</a>: ONS)</figcaption>	
		<p>You can see how real income steadily climbed, plateauing slightly
		in the early and late 70s before continuing rising up until the Financial
		Crisis, since when it has basically flatlined. </p>
		<p>Now to compare real disposable income per head against house prices. 
		But first, Fig. 6 is a visual of the bitcoin price history before the 
		Christmas 2017 crash…just kidding: although it does resemble cryptomanic
		speculation, really it’s showing something called the affordability
		 ratio (ironic, I know), which for this figure is the average house 
		 price in a given year divided by the real income per head in the same year.</p> 
		<img src="Images/UK_house_affordability.png" alt="House affordability against time">
		<figcaption>Fig. 6. Affordability ratio of UK houses
		(<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihxy/ukea">
		Source</a>: ONS Real households' disposable income per head, CVM NSA and 
		Nationwide average house price).</figcaption>
		<p>You’ll notice Fig. 6 looks remarkably similar to Fig. 2. This is
		because wage growth has been roughly linear and a much weaker trend 
		compared to house price growth. Interestingly, factoring in wage growth
		actually accentuates the house price booms (and busts), as these seem 
		to happen in times where wage growth is low; if “work” isn’t paying well, 
		people seek to make profit from housing instead.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>The millennial’s cry of previous generations being lucky to buy 
		houses when they were “cheap” does seem to hold up based on the 
		affordability ratio alone. Older generations will refer to the punitively
		high interest rates in the past, but those rates were often accompanied
		by similar levels of inflation that helped their debts to evaporate away.</p>
		<p>Houses are expensive things, especially if you don’t have one. And they 
		are getting more and more expensive all the time. Although income can be 
		measured in many ways, the trend is clear in that wages cannot keep up with
		rising house prices. This makes it tough to buy your first house because 
		of the large, upfront deposit. As well as being somewhere to live, a house
		is the largest and least diversified investment a person will ever make. 
		Houses that cost many multiples of their salaries are forcing the younger
		generation to plough <i>vast</i> amounts of their wealth into a single asset.
		This exposes them to significant investment risk and likely to prevents
		them from building up a decent pension or other savings.</p>
		<p>There is no quick fix for this problem. Looks like for now us millennials
			will just have to carry on moaning.</p>
		<p>What do you think? Should millennials stop wasting all their money on
		smart phones and just bite the bullet of today's house prices? Leave your
		comments below.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Note 1 – things to bear in mind when using the Nationwide house price data</p>
		<p>The Nationwide house price methodology has developed over time and this
		needs to be considered when interpreting the long run series of house 
		prices.  Maintenance in terms of updating weights for the mix-adjustment
		process is carried out at regular intervals.</p>
		<p>Significant developments include:</p>
				
		<ul style="padding-left:30px; color:#444">
			<li>1952 - 1959 Q4 Simple average of purchase price.</li>
			<li>1960 Q1 - 1973 Q4  - weighted average using floor area 
			(thus allowing for the influence of house size).</li>
			<li>1974 Q1 - 1982 Q4 - weighted averages using 
			floor area, region and property type.</li>
			<li>1983 Q1 -  Development of new house price methodology.  
			A statistical ‘regression’ technique was introduced under
			guidance of ‘Fleming and Nellis’ (Loughborough University and
			Cranfield Institute of Technology).  This was introduced in
			1989 but data was revised back to 1983 Q1.</li>
			<li>•	1993 - Information about neighbourhood classification 
			(ACORN) used in the model were significantly updated following 
			Census 1991 publication - regular updates since but typically 
			for new postcodes.</li>
		</ul>		
		<p>Note 2 – median income vs real household’s disposable income (RHDI) per head:</p>
		<p>I contacted the ONS to ask about differences in methodology between
		RHDI and median annualised incomes. Their
		response was that they were not directly comparable. Median income
		focuses only on how much an individual earns (rather than households) based
		on their tax records (PAYE). RHDI looks at the amount money
		a household has available to spend after tax and is adjusted for inflation, such
		that is a measure of the real purchasing power of households over time.
		It's perhaps unsurprising then that Fig 7, which is a comparison of
		the affordability ratio for median income and RDHI for the years the data sets overlap
		, shows a worse affordability ratio for RDHI. However, the trendlines 
		closely match so they paint a similar picture of house prices 
		outstripping wage growth. </p>
