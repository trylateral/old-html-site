			<p>Life can seem overwhelming. We're set with challenges that seem insurmountable. On a daily basis we're pounded with news so negative that if an alien were to come down from space and turn on the t.v. he or she (or it?) would assume the time of humanity was up and the apocalypse was upon us. We spend our lives being told that the things we want to do are so difficult that we should not embarrass ourselves by even trying.</p> 
			
			<p>The aim of this blog is to help de-code the bullshit we're subjected to using...drum roll, please...science and data! And to show ways we can grow so that skills or activities people say are hard can be tackled just as easy as the IT department's rugby team.</p>

	<div class="maintext">
			<p>Many of the blog posts deal with topics that are often misrepresented. Much of this misrepresentation is not deliberate lying, but rather comes from the need of news outlets to tell a simple and consistent narrative, which does not lend itself to objective analysis of the data. The aim of this blog is to look beyond the headlines and push as far towards objective discussion as possible.</p>

		<h2>It's not as hard as you think</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="maintext">
		<p>Neither is this a self-help, shout-at-yourself-in-the-mirror kind of site. But we do deal with skills, activities and adventures that are often considered challenging, or possibly even dangerous, by most members of the public. Some of the issues are personal to me, others are inspired by the experiences of others.</p>
