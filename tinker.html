		<h1>A book review: ‘Venezuela: What everyone needs to know', by Miguel Tinker Salas</h1>
		<p>I have been searching around for a book about Venezuela, the home country of my partner. My knowledge of Venezuela before I met her was as follows:</p>
		<ol style="padding-left:30px; color:#444">
			<li>They have oil.</li>
			<li>The women are beautiful.*</li>
			<li>The Disney film “Up!” was set there.</li>
			<li>The country was run until recently by a chap called Chávez: a socialist, a populist and a loud-mouth. He died several years ago.</li>
			<li>It’s too dangerous to go backpacking there; the one guy I met in South America who had tempted it had been robbed…at gunpoint…in the airport…by the security staff…that’s a spectacular level of fucked-up.</li>
		</ol>		
		<p>My partner has, of course, filled me in on a lot more since then. Still, I thought
		I should sit down and swot up on the country’s past, hoping maybe it would explain how 
		it ended up where it is today. Aware of my yearning for a-learning, my partner bought 
		me for my birthday ‘Venezuela: What everyone needs to know ‘ by Miguel Tinker Salas.
		A little tipsy home from dinner, I sat down with this short (218 pages) book, the
		cover all socialist red and fluttering flags.</p>
		<img src="Images/tinker_small.jpg" alt="Front cover of Miguel Tinker Salas's book Venezuela What Everyone Needs to Know">
		<figcaption>Perhaps the quote on the cover should have been a hint of things to come?</figcaption>
		<p>The book is divided into three parts: one covering the history of Venezuela 
		from the colonial to the modern era, a second covering the oil boom and 20th century 
		Venezuela up to the rise of Chávez, and a third covering the period under Chávez
		and his buffoonish successor Nicolas Maduro. I found part one (Venezuela before oil)
		to be an interesting and informative meander through the stories and legends
		surrounding the nation’s founding fathers (and mothers), with much focus on the 
		structure of the colonial economy. As we’ll see below, a similar level of economic criticism of the
		Chávez era is notable by its absence.</p>
		<p>Part two begins with the discovery of that lubricator of economies, that 
		liquid gold…that black curse…oil. Throughout Venezuela’s turbulent 20th century 
		history, oil runs thickly and deeply. Tinker notes that oil brought the wealth 
		that allowed the country early access to the fruits of American modernity: electricity, 
		refrigeration, Hollywood, Cadillacs and baseball. For much of the 20th century, 
		Venezuela was led by military strongmen and presidents selected by a self-serving senate
		in a constant struggle for a cut of the oil boom’s riches. Western-style democracy 
		arrived in the second half of the century, although corruption and nepotism continued
		to plague the country. Tinker goes on to argue that although oil enriched a lucky 
		class of white, upper and middle class Venezuelans, this never seeped down to 
		improve the lot of the lower classes, much of whom are of mixed
		European-indigenous-African descent. Tinker claims that inequality brought
		principally by the exploitative practices of foreign oil companies and a nationalised
		but arms-length oil enterprise called PdVSA created fertile ground for 
		the rise of a socialist movement in Venezuela. </p>
		<p>From the beginning of the book, the author's
		left-wing views are apparent, although I don't think his treatment of the 
		history up to the era of Chávez was partisan to the point of obscuring the 
		truth. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for part three of the book.</p>
		<p>Tinker’s treats the Chávez/Maduro period in the final eighty pages
		of the book. His natural support for the “leftist” and “progressive”
		government of Chávez/Maduro leads to a real deterioration in the quality
		and objectivity of the analysis in this section. I expected to read about
		the economic mismanagement, the spiralling inflation, the souring of foreign
		relations (except for making friends with such “progressive” forces as Iran,
		Libya and Russia), the descent into lawlessness, the state-organised corruption
		and the violent repression by the security forces.
		Instead I read about a "progressive" regime that protects the poor
		and does battle against hostile national and international forces.</p>
		<p>In particular, Tinker focussed on the <i>misiones</i>:
		government programmes to improve the life 
		of the poor. The programmes aim to bring healthcare, education, housing
		and electoral participation to the poorest neighbourhoods. Of course, 
		this sounds like an honourable thing to do. However, Tinker doesn’t 
		discuss the ways in which these programmes have been abused by party 
		and government officials as ways to indoctrinate children 
		(be re-writing history books), intimidate voters (by arming local 
		mobs called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectivo_(Venezuela)">“colectivos”</a>),
		launder money, or secure new homes for their family members or business 
		connections. Much of the contracts for work on the <i>misiones</i> are alleged
		to be at inflated values, with officials lining their pockets with 
		"commission". He also doesn’t discuss whether such programmes were
		effective or affordable in the long-term given falling government non-oil 
		revenues. The reality is that Venezuela relied on high oil prices to fund
		lavish social programmes without creating the environment for the non-oil
		economy to flourish. Despite relying so heavily on its oil revenues, the 
		Chávez/Maduro government oversaw new levels of corruption and mismanagement
		within PdVSA. Oil production is at its <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/news/economy/venezuela-oil-production/index.html">lowest in three decades</a>
		despite massive untapped reserves. All this meant that when the oil 
		price collapsed in 2014 economic disaster was inevitable.</p>
		<p>I recognise this book was written around 2014, when it was just 
		about possible for the most idealogical of Western "progressive" 
		thinkers to still see the positive side of the Bolivarian revolution. 
		However, as someone whose family has been directly affected, I
		found it incredible that the book makes no mention of the damage 
		caused by the Chavistas' attempt at a planned economy. The author 
		does not claim to be an economist, but I would have thought it obvious
		that a government bent on appropriating private business and property 
		is disastrous for the economy. Who would invest in a business that 
		could be snatched away at any moment? There is discussion of the 
		currency controls of the pre-Chávez era, but little mention of it
		under Chávez and Maduro, nor the hyperinflation (although the worst 
		of that has happened since 2014). The author is either avoiding the 
		facts or else hasn't understood that a dysfunctional home economy
		coupled with an inability to import goods due to currency controls 
		is by far the most important cause of the shortages of staple goods. 
		Communism has been shown not to work, time and time again. 
		Miguel Tinker Salas does not seem to have got the memo.</p>
		<p>The suggestion of "international political pressures" 
		being in part responsible for shortages feels disingenuous, as 
		to my knowledge the only sanctions in place at the time Tinker
		wrote the book were on the sale of arms (due to Venezuela’s failure 
		to prevent drugs trafficking) and against individual government
		officials involved in the violent suppression of opposition
		protests in 2014. However, Tinker’s point-of-view fits with 
		Chávista rhetoric of an economic war being waged against Venezuela
		by the capitalist American pigs.</p>
		<p>What is most infuriating is that the author is a Venezuelan
		living in the US; he's one of the lucky ones who got out. He derides
		a middle class who he alleges oppose the government only for fear 
		of losing their positions of status in society. As a member of 
		the American middle-class, one wonders about Tinker's <i>own</i> position of status
		. Tinker has access to the decadent wonders of the modern world,
		principally clean water, supermarkets overflowing with food, 
		reliable electricity, functioning transport infrastructure, safe 
		streets and public spaces, great schools, hospitals with hi-tech
		equipment, and so on. Academics like Tinker
		always seem to take such things for granted when writing from their cosy college
		campus about “progressive”, socialist governments in the developing world. </p>
		<p>My partner’s middle-class family spend up to eight hours in a
		line to buy flour and oil. Often there is none left once they
		make it to the front. When on holiday in Spain or Portugal, we
		do tours of pharmacies to buy the medicine that keeps my partner’s
		father alive (in the UK a doctor’s prescription is usually required).
		Medicine is now almost impossible to come by in Venezuela. And
		I’m not talking some weird, specialist drug; unbelievably, we even 
		have to send boxes of aspirin. And when I say send, I mean find a friend 
		who is travelling back to Venezuela, because the postal service is highly 
		unreliable (many allege customs officials take parcels to sell on the black market). 
		I say to you, Miguel Tinker Salas,
		have you tried living in Venezuela recently? What planet are
		you living on when you suggest that life in Venezuela has improved
		under Chávismo? Yes, the social programs undoubtedly raised,
		temporarily, the standard of living of the country’s poorest.
		But the approach was unsustainable. Thanks to Chávez and his 
		successors, I had to watch my partner cry at the sight of someone we know
		arriving in Spain from Venezuela: they were 
		incredibly thin, having eaten once-a-day for the last two 
		years, mostly just pasta and margarine, occasionally an egg.
		And this was before we discovered they had contracted an infection
		from contaminated food. In a way, they were one of the 
		lucky ones. Many now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-39140060">find their food in the refuse sacks</a> 
		outside homes and businesses. As recently as July 2016, Tinker claimed 
		that there is no crisis in Venezuela, that <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/news/2016/06/27-venezuela-expert-miguel-tinker-salas-breaks-down-nation%E2%80%99s-crisis">no one is starving.</a> </p>
		<p>Tinker paints a picture of a government opposition out to sabotage 
		Chavez’s plans to raise the lower classes out of poverty. He downplays 
		opposition protests about the repression of the media. I mean yeah, OK, 
		Venezuela lags behind Myanmar, Mali and Afghanistan in the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index#Rankings_and_scores_by_country">Press Freedom Index</a>,
		but it’s not that bad, is it? Again, the worst of what has
		happened has taken place since the publishing of the book, but the writing
		was already on the wall. We’re talking about the government shutting
		down TV channels, both national such as RCTV and international 
		such as <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/venezuela-censorship-nicolas-maduro-cnn-censorship-557305">CNN</a>, 
		and censorship of all major news outlets in the country. The <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2017/venezuela">only reliable
		news</a> from inside Venezuela now comes via social media.</p>
		<p>It’s hard to know where to start or stop when describing how bad the
		situation is in Venezuela. We simply can’t grasp it as pampered westerners.
		Can you imagine your government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopoldo_L%C3%B3pez#Imprisonment">arresting opposition politicians</a>
		, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Ledezma#Escape_from_house_arrest">kidnapping and imprisoning the mayor</a> of your capital city? </p>
		<p>I don’t mean for this review to be a personal attack on Miguel Tinker Salas. 
		I am just frustrated that on the subject of Venezuela he seems to be one
		of the main voices of authority in the developed world. In many ways,
		his views are common. It’s easy to find socialist writers and politicians 
		in the UK who support the Venezuelan regime. Frighteningly, the leader 
		of the opposition Labour party is one of them (try <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/309065744954580992?lang=en">this</a>  and <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/835994/Corbyn-Venezuela-Nicolas-Maduro-Hugo-Chavez-Labour-Party-Watch-Video">this<a>).
		Such ideologues need a fresh dose of reality: capitalism has brought <i>billions</i> 
		of people out of poverty in a way socialist China and Russia never could.
		Yes, capitalism without restraints is harmful, but the way to solve the 
		problem is to forcefully legislate in a way that both encourages business 
		and protects workers. Yes, we need social programs, but we also need entrepreneurs.
		The path to populist socialism always ends at the 
		same place: the bread line.</p>
