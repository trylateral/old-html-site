		<h2 id="part1">Part 1: The century of the working man and woman</h2>
		<p>In the United Kingdom, the 20th century belonged to the working man and woman. 
		It was the century in which working people found themselves holding if not 
		all the cards, then enough of them to make a decent run of things. 
		Industrial growth was dramatic and ever reliant on the hard graft of the
		working classes. It was also the century during which organised labour got 
		its act together. The power of unscrupulous employers and rentiers begun to
		be reined in by that of worker solidarity. In politics, we saw the rise of 
		the Labour Party as the defender of the working classes.</p>
		<p>Militarily, the nation state was at the height of its power with 
		conscripted armies running into the several millions at times. During
		WWI and WWII, the UK dedicated a huge proportion of its economic activity
		to the waging of total war, an experience with lasting effects on the economic
		thinkers of the time [Note 1]. But in the monstrous size of 20th century
		armies lay also their biggest weakness; even the grandest of armies would
		melt before the enemy if it lacked the tacit support of the lower classes,
		just as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/eastern_front_01.shtml">Tsarist Russia experienced in 1917</a>.
		The strength of the British government was ensured by the loyalty of its
		humble tommies.</p>
		<p>After 1945, thankfully few Brits would die defending ol’ Blighty. 
		Although countless millions still lived in poverty, the working class saw 
		their living standards rise dramatically through the post-war era. This
		came thanks to an expanding economy that still depended heavily on manual 
		labour. There were skilled jobs aplenty, and the pay and conditions of those 
		jobs were successfully defended and improved upon by the trade unions. </p>
		<p>The children of the working classes often entered skilled and professional
		careers. By the end of the century around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/feb/26/uk-more-middle-class-than-working-class-2000-data">
		half of the UK considered itself middle class</a>. For those who couldn’t find
		or were unfit for work, an ever-expanding social safety net was introduced.
		Houses were being built, and were much more affordable than today
		(see <a href="./house_prices.html">my blog</a> on this topic). </p>
		<p>For the working man, the 20th century was by no means perfect. 
		For every skilled worker with a pension plan, there was someone else
		struggling to make ends meet. For every sector that saw growth and investment,
		there were others in decay and decline. Yet, on average, the picture to be
		painted is an improving one, all thanks to the ever-increasing value of elbow 
		grease, hard graft and an honest day’s work.</p>
		<p>I suppose what I am saying is that the 20th century for the working classes 
		represented a happy sort of paradox. Work was at once the source of their enslavement
		and their empowerment. Enslavement in that only by working gruelling days at the
		mine or factory could they pay their way in life. Empowerment in that it was the
		value of <i>their labour</i> that was fuelling an expanding economy and 
		ever-rising standard of living. Britain as a nation was indebted to the working class.
		Without their support, key industries would (and did) grind to a halt, and armies would
		flounder.</p>
		
		<h2 id="part2">Part 2: A slave to the wage</h2>
		<p>From here on, I am going to lump together the working class and 
		a significant proportion of the middle class. Let’s call these people 
		the “wage class”. These are the people whose income derives mostly, 
		usually overwhelmingly, from salaries and wages in return for their labour.
		This encompasses even more people than you might guess. An apparent high-roller
		with BMWs on the gravel driveway may be so far under water with mortgages 
		and car loans that two months out of work would leave him or her filing
		for bankruptcy.</p>
		<p>Most of the wage class aren’t high rollers. Most of the wage 
		class are just doing their best to pay the bills, allowing for a holiday and keeping a 
		little aside for a rainy day. And I do mean a “little”: in 2018, 
		<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-household-saving-ratio-2017-ons-inflation-income-expenditure-a8279016.html">
		the UK household savings ratio fell to 4.9%</a>, its lowest level since 1963.
		Meanwhile, real wage growth is stagnant (see Fig 5 <a href="http://davidjwatson.com/house_prices.html">here</a>). </p>
		<p>During the 20th century and early noughties, this wage class way of life 
		wasn’t so bad. If you put in forty years of hard work your employer would
		reward you with a comfortable, final salary pension. Yet this way of life
		now feels like a distant past. Defined benefit (final salary) pensions have 
		all but disappeared. Companies have cleverly offloaded pension risk onto you,
		the worker, and now it’s all about defined <i>contributions</i>, 
		not benefits; what you <i>put in</i> is defined, what you <i>get out</i> 
		at the end is anyone’s guess. Anyone under 50 who bumbles through life 
		without paying their pension much attention will get a nasty shock when 
		they reach 65 and hope to retire. </p>
		<p>If we’re all going to be living much longer, it’s likely the 
		government will keep pushing back pension ages. Of those born today,
		<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2014to2016">
		20-30% of them are expected to live past 90 years old</a>. Who knows, perhaps
		a future government will only allow us to retire once we can prove we are no
		longer fit for work? </p>
		
		<h2 id="part3">Part 3: When work doesn’t pay</h3>
		<p>There have been two main trends in the UK economy since the 1970s: 
		Firstly, there’s been a <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/04/17/1523941200000/The-decline-in-manufacturing--charted/">
		huge decline</a> in the relative importance of industry as an employer. Secondly,
		market reforms were introduced in the 1980s, ostensibly to stimulate the
		economy through debt-fuelled growth and increased private-sector competition.</p>
		<p>How did our wage class fare in this deindustrialisation and market
		liberalisation? The wage class have certainly been <i>big</i> users of one aspect
		of market liberalisation: that of easy credit. Modern finance has
		turned out to be somewhat of a double-edged sword. Easy credit has 
		allowed the wage class to maintain a high standard of living today 
		through loans and credit cards, whilst inflicting financial self-harm
		in the long term. Meanwhile, the banks reap the rewards of heavy
		interest payments and defaults (until it causes a Financial Crisis, at least). </p>
		<p>In raw economic terms, many would argue that the UK wage class 
		has seen their quality of life erode, or at least stagnate, in the 
		period since market liberalisation and deindustrialisation. The wage
		class’s share of the UK economic pie has been shrinking, although 
		the growth of the pie itself has managed to just about offset this. </p>
		<p>Since the 1980s, many “good” (well-paid, secure) working class
		jobs have disappeared. The trade unions, whose power to improve 
		the lot of the working class was so great throughout most of the
		20th century, seem to have <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/09/economist-explains-19/">lost 
		both their power and their appeal</a>. In fact, union members in 2018 
		are <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/616966/trade-union-membership-statistical-bulletin-2016-rev.pdf">
		much more likely to be middle-class</a> professionals in the public
		sector than working class.</p>
		<p>To be sure, new jobs <i>have</i> been created in this 
		liberalised world, but often for the working class these are jobs 
		with fewer career prospects and on insecure contracts. For the 
		middle class, the cushy pensions have disappeared and both adults
		in a family have to work to cover the bills.</p>
		<p>So if the economic pie has been growing but the wage class’s 
		slice is getting smaller, where is all the money going? The answer
		is simple: to capital.</p>
		
		<h2 id="part4">Part 4: Get rich by owning stuff</h2>
		<p>Whilst the wage class has been quietly carrying on much 
		as they have done since 1945, the richer part of society has
		been very busy. The rich (or aspiring rich) have always understood 
		that not only can you get paid for the time and skills you provide, 
		i.e. your <i>labour</i>, but there is also money to be made by 
		owning <i>stuff</i>. Quite a lot of money, it turns out.</p>
		<p>Owning stuff is referred to as <i>capital</i>, and includes 
		cash, shares (including owning your own business), bonds and
		property, as well as what are known as “tangible factors of 
		production” such as machinery (including robots), production 
		equipment and software.</p>
		<p>With the liberalisation of investing and finance in the 
		1980s, owning stuff became a lot easier. Those with the money 
		and knowledge have been making <a href="https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2014/10/24/the-ftse-100-will-always-beat-you/">
		fantastic returns</a> through the stock market, 
		property (see my <a href="./house_prices.html">blog post</a> on this) 
		and the smorgasbord of financial products available to the savvy
		investor. Digital technology is making access to such products easier
		than ever.</p>
		<p>All around the world, labour is losing out to capital. 
		Labour is capturing a <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/10/31/labour-pains">
		smaller percentage of all income<a/> now than it did in the past. 
		This is not supposed to happen; economists since the 1950s 
		have tended to assume the flow of income to labour as being 
		constant. But in recent years productivity gains 
		have disproportionately flown towards the owners of capital 
		instead of towards a broader growth in wages. Simply put, since 
		the 1980s in the UK we’ve seen the rich getting richer and the 
		wage class if not getting poorer, then not seeing any improvement
		in their standard of living. That’s a lost generation of wage
		growth hoovered up the rich. </p>
		<p>The wage class is overwhelmingly reliant on the value of
		their labour to provide income. The relative value of that labour
		is no longer increasing at anything like the levels we saw in 
		the 20th century. Machines in factories that were once run by
		skilled workers are now automated, only requiring a skeleton
		staff of engineers to run them. More and more menial and 
		time-consuming tasks will soon be completed by 
		artificial intelligence (check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM">
		Google Duplex</a>). Some argue we can create more services jobs
		to offset this automation. But as the growth of the services 
		industry since the 80s in the UK shows, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1c57dcb0-aa89-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97">
		over-reliance on services may have contributed to low productivity growth.</a></p>
		<p>It's possible that the emergence of private companies earning 
		monopoly profits for the provision of public goods (think trains, 
		energy, water, healthcare) has also caused money to drain away from 
		the taxpayer to shareholders, private equity and hedge funds.</p>
		
		<h2 id="part5">Part 5: Train up or lose out?</h2>
		<p>So what’s the solution to the falling value of labour? 
		Successive British governments seem to believe there is only 
		one solution: “Education, education, education” : those were 
		the three things Tony Blair promised to focus on in his 1997
		election campaign. The <i>average</i> value of labour is 
		falling, but if you train up, go to university, you’ll land
		yourself a well-paid job in a high-tech sector. And it’s not
		just the UK; this has been the policy followed in many 
		developed countries in recent years (with countries like 
		Germany perhaps being exceptions). </p>
		<p>Education is of course essential for the success of 
		the economy, but this is not a modern phenomenon and the
		importance of academic study (as opposed to on-the-job training)
		has been overstated (see the fantastic book <i>23 Things They Don’t 
		Tell You About Capitalism</i> by Ha-Joon Chang for more on this).</p>
		<p>In the UK, the Labour government made it a keystone policy 
		to get 50% of young people going to university. Even in a scenario 
		where this is achieved and every single graduate finds a skilled,
		professional job, this still leaves the obvious
		question: what of the 50% of society not attending university? 
		The fact that the Labour party, traditionally the party of the working
		class and the “bottom” 50%, was so obsessed with university attendance
		is another story in itself (In fact, Thomas Frank already took the 
		liberty of telling this story in his excellent book <i>Listen, Liberal</i>.
		His focus is the US Democratic Party, but the story with the 
		Labour Party is strikingly similar).</p>
		<p>If you’re in the non-university 50% of society (the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/648165/HEIPR_PUBLICATION_2015-16.pdf">
		figure</a> for higher education attendance was the highest ever at 
		49% in 2015/16), is it likely that you’ll ever be able to
		become a programming guru or robotics engineer? If not, then is
		this your fault given that at least a significant portion of your
		intelligence was doled out to you at birth anyway (<a href ="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-018-0019-8">general estimates</a> are upwards of 30%)?  </p>
		<p>We’ve seen how labour’s share of income is decreasing despite 
		the increased university attendance of one half of society. 
		If education isn’t working, what else could government do to 
		stimulate real wage growth? They could reinstate higher levels 
		of taxation of the rich that have been swept away since the 1970s.
		However, politically this seems very unlikely to happen. This 
		finally brings me, you’ll be relieved to know, to the idea I 
		hinted at in the opening paragraph of this meandering essay.</p>
		
		<h2 id="part6">Part 6: Beat them at their own game</h2>
		<p>What we need is for the wage class to follow the example
		of the rich because, as we all know, if you can’t beat 
		‘em, join ‘em. If the economy is geared so that more and more 
		of income growth from improvements in productivity are
		funnelled to the owners of capital, we need a way for the wage 
		class to <i>become</i> the owners [Note 2]. </p>
		<p>To be sure, being paid for work is essential to 
		the economic success of the wage class. However, except for the very 
		few professions that pay their practitioners so well that
		no matter how fast they burn through the cash they’ll always
		end up wealthy, the key for most is to break the wage-slave 
		cycle as soon as is possible. That means putting aside as
		much of their income from labour as they can afford into 
		some kind of investment.</p>
		<p>Beyond being rewarded for the shares they owned in companies,
		the small amount of capital owned by an individual could be 
		clubbed with the small amounts from many other individuals, 
		and together they would have real influence over the running of 
		the companies they were invested in. Let's call this clubbing together
		an "investment cooperative".</p>
		<p>Imagine an investing cooperative that takes up a position 
		within a FTSE 100 company. The cooperative is not simply seeking
		financial gain from this investment, but to use its position to 
		further the interests of its members. The cooperative pressures
		the board to improve the pay of their workers whilst reining in 
		executive pay. Traditionally, it was the role of trade unions to
		secure pay and conditions through the collective bargaining power of labour.
		The investment cooperative would secure financial return <i>and</i>
		pay and conditions (at least for the companies it invests in) using
		the collective bargaining power of <i>capital</i> instead of labour.<p>
		The cooperative could be wholly-owned by the investors 
		and run democratically through elections and referenda. 
		It could have a constitution to ensure certain basic rights
		and objectives are maintained, such as the cooperative’s role
		in fair pay for workers in the companies in which it invests.</p>
		<p>At this point, you may be thinking this all sounds like
		something that governments should be doing, not a cooperative. 
		It should be governments that enforce improvements in pay and 
		conditions, that create taxes to redistribute wealth, and it 
		should be governments that take ownership of certain key 
		industries or infrastructure to be run for the public good.
		My humble opinion is that the government is <i>not</i> 
		doing nearly enough of this right now. What is needed 
		is a quiet revolution in investing that allows the wage 
		class to claw back some of the gains made by the richest 
		members of society. </p>
		<p>Other readers may think this all sounds a bit Marxist, 
		workers owning the means of production, etc. However, 
		the cooperative would rely on funds from individual investors,
		all of whom would seek to gain financially from their
		investment, both in gains in share price and dividends 
		as well as through eventual improvement in pay and conditions
		for workers (if they happened to work for a company in the
		portfolio). The investors would be responding to financial 
		incentives, and would vote to elect a leadership competent 
		in managing their investments; it would remain a firmly 
		capitalist venture, but capitalist in ways perhaps not 
		seen before.</p>
		<p>I know that many of the things I am suggesting
		this cooperative do can already be done by individuals.
		Anyone can buy a share in a listed company, attend AGMs
		and cast their vote on key decisions. There remain two
		main problems with this approach. Firstly, it is daunting 
		for the ‘man on the street’ to buy shares directly. It 
		requires experience, time and usually a broker (who of 
		course wants some money for the trouble). There do
		exist relatively low-cost online brokers, but their 
		underlying motive will always be to profit from your
		custom. </p>
		<p>An investment cooperative could manage the
		technical side of investing, and with economies of 
		scale could do so at low cost [Note 3], returning any
		profit back to its investors. Joining the cooperative
		could be made as straight forward as possible, with 
		simple, clear information on the risks and benefits.
		Secondly, although every vote counts, by clubbing
		together your interests with a large number of other 
		investors you are much more likely to influence the
		decisions of a company. Only by owning large stakes
		within companies can real change be effected.</p>
		<p>You may worry that investing is a risky activity. 
		It definitely is possible to lose money through
		investing in shares (directly or through a cooperative).
		However, data shows that diversified investments,
		if held for the long-term, are very likely to provide 
		positive returns [Note 4].</p>
		
		<h2>A way forwards</h2>
		<p>I believe that an investment cooperative has the
		potential to allow members of the wage class to both 
		profit from the benefits of an expanding economy in 
		the same way as their richer counterparts, and to be 
		a new source of influence and power in pursuit of fairer
		pay and conditions for workers throughout the UK.</p>
		<p>I’d more than welcome any criticism or suggestions 
		to take forwards the ideas I’ve laid out. You can get
		in touch via the comments below or by emailing me on 
		mail@davidjwatson.com.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<p>[Note 1] It does well to think that nationalisation
		in the UK came out of the experience of war, where an 
		astonishing proportion of UK economic activity was 
		funnelled into government hands, perhaps justly so in
		WWII, but more controversially when thinking of the 
		killing fields of 1914-18 Flanders.</p>
		<p>[Note 2] As we move inextricably towards an 
		automated economy run by robots, there’s a chance it
		will become harder and harder to make money any way 
		other than by owning the means of production or by 
		governments redistributing the profits of corporations 
		down to their citizens. This is probably in quite
		a distant future, and currently unimagined jobs 
		will also be created, as I discussed <a href="./ubi.html">here</a>, 
		that will replace those that are destroyed.</p>
		<p>[Note 3] Vanguard US provides a good starting point 
		as a model for this investment cooperative. It provides
		low cost “tracker” funds that are owned by the investors.
		Where it falls short is that there is no democratic 
		structure that allows individual investors to vote 
		on company issues; all shareholder votes are passed
		by proxy to Vanguard management. Vanguard UK or Nutmeg
		provide the closest equivalents in the UK, but 
		both are “for profits” ventures and are not owned 
		by the investors in their products.</p>
		<p>[Note 4] Barclay’s produced a white paper showing 
		that, since the 1970s, being invested for 12 years
		always led to a positive return, even if you had 
		bought right before the 2008 crash or the Dotcom 
		bubble.</p>
